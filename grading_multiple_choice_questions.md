Suppose there are eight students and ten questions, and the answers are stored in a twodimensional
list. Each row records a student’s answers to the questions, as shown in the
following illustration

## Students’ Answers to the Questions

| Student   | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 |
|-----------|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Student 0 | A | B | A | C | C | D | E | E | A | D |
| Student 1 | D | B | A | B | C | A | E | E | A | D |
| Student 2 | E | D | D | A | C | B | E | E | A | D |
| Student 3 | C | B | A | E | D | C | E | E | A | D |
| Student 4 | A | B | D | C | C | D | E | E | A | D |
| Student 5 | B | B | E | C | C | D | E | E | A | D |
| Student 6 | B | B | A | C | C | D | E | E | A | D |
| Student 7 | E | B | E | C | C | D | E | E | A | D |


The key is stored in a one-dimensional list:
### Key to the Questions

| Key   | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 |
|-------|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Answer| D | B | D | C | C | D | A | E | A | D |

Write a program that grades the test and displays the result. To do this, the program compares each
student’s answers with the key, counts the number of correct answers, and displays it.
