// Geometry: area of a triangle) Write a program that prompts the user to enter the
// three points (x1, y1), (x2, y2), and (x3, y3) of a triangle and displays its area.
// The formula for computing the area of a triangle is s = (side1 + side2 + side3) / 2
// Area = sqrt(s(s-side1)(s-side2)(s-side3))
// Example: Enter three points for a triangle: 1.5, -3.4, 4.6, 5, 9.5, -3.4 
// The area of the triangle is 33.6
